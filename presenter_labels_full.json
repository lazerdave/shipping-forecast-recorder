In a couple of minutes, we'll join the BBC World Service, he'll take us through the night,  before we return at 5.30 in the morning with the shipping bulletin.  Earlier today we had a wonderful profile of the artist David Hulkney, that's on BBC Sounds.  Now, if you missed it, well worth a listen. He also heard from John Lloyd on loose ends,  the comedy producer, and learned a bit about the science of brain computer interfaces in  the infinite monkey cage. But for now, thank you very much for your company this evening,  it's Tom Sanders here.",
